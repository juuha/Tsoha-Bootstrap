<h3>Waking Up</h3>
<!-- Tiedot tulee t채h채n -->

<p>
  You wake up in a weird room with 4 doors, 1 on each of the walls surrounding you. You see a compass stuck on the floor in the middle of the room. It points north towards the door in front of you. You feel a sense of urgency, but aren't sure why.
</p>
<p>
  What are you going to do?
